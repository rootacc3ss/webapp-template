# Global Rules

## Introduction

This file contains global rules that apply to the entire project.

Discuss the stack here. Engineer a good intro and find additional rules to add. Make sure to include the info from perplexity about giving the agent a character and context.

## Rule One: Design
- If the user prompts any specific designs, do them to the best of your ability.
- Use the full stack to the best of your ability to create a beautiful and modern design. Use the design rules to guide your design.
- Must be responsive on all devices.
- Must naturally include enhancements like tasteful animations, transitions, gradients, glows and other UI/UX elements.
- Keep design persistent through the entire project, refer to index and other pages if you have to while creating new pages and layouts.

### Subrules for Design
- Add context and rules here, like best design practices from Lovable, bolt.diy and research.

## Rule Two: Best Practices
- Use best practices in programming, design and database management.
- If implementing something new (APIs, integrations, features, technologies, etc.), ask the user if they want to research the topic first using Context7 and/or Perplexity MCP to learn best practices.
