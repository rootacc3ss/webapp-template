# Introduction

This file is used to introduce the user and AI to the "best practices" system. It contains an outline of the file structure, explaining each folder and file's purpose, as well as a description of the system and its intended use. Add setup.md here too.

It should be a very descriptive introduction and overview of the best way to use the system, and when the AI is prompted to read it, the AI should initiate a checklist with the user, included in this file, to ensure the user is using the system correctly. Also prompt the user to finish supabase installation as outlined in the setup.md file.
